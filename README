Bizarre Cards
=============

The following cards break stuff, either by not following The Rules or by just
plain doing strange things in their characteristics. There may be more of each
oddity, I just picked the first one alphabetically.

* Architects of Will

It's type line reads "Artifact Creature -- Human Wizard", flaunting its
blatant disregard for rule 205.3c.

* Seeds of Strength

Wins a prize for having the same exact ability multiple times.
Besides messing with my table schema, this seems like a usability fail.

* Mishra's Factory

Simultaneously a rare and an uncommon in the same set.
